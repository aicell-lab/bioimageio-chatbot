## Your Personal Assistant in BioImage Analysis

Welcome to the BioImage.IO Chatbot user guide. This guide will help you get the most out of the chatbot, providing detailed information on how to interact with it and retrieve valuable insights related to bioimage analysis.

## Introduction

The BioImage.IO Chatbot is a versatile conversational agent designed to assist users in accessing information related to bioimage analysis. It leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrates user-specific data to provide contextually accurate and personalized responses. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or scientist, the chatbot is here to make your bioimage analysis journey smoother and more informative.

## Chatbot Features

The BioImage.IO Chatbot offers the following features:

* **Contextual Understanding**: The chatbot can understand the context of your questions, ensuring responses are relevant and informative.

* **Personalization**: By incorporating your background information, the chatbot tailors responses to meet your specific requirements.

* **Document Retrieval**: It can search through extensive documentation to provide detailed information on models, applications, datasets, and more. Up to this day, the ChatBot is able to retrieve information from the [bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io), [bio.tools](https://bio.tools), [deepImageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io) and [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io/#/).

* **Query Structured Database by Script Execution**: The chatbot can generate Python scripts for complex queries in structured databases (e.g. csv, json file, SQL databases etc.), helping you perform advanced tasks such as specific questions about the available models at [bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io).

## Using the Chatbot

You can visit the BioImage.IO Chatbot at [https://chat.bioimage.io](https://chat.bioimage.io). Please note that the chatbot is still in beta and is being actively developed. If you encounter any issues, please report them via [Github issues](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimageio-chatbot/issues).

### Asking Questions

To ask the chatbot a question, simply type your query and send it. The chatbot will analyze your question and provide a relevant response. You can ask questions related to bioimage analysis, software tools, models, and more.

### Personalized Responses

The chatbot uses your user profile information, such as your name, occupation, and background, to personalize its responses. This ensures that the information you receive is tailored to your specific needs.

## Setup the Chatbot Server Locally

To run the chatbot, you need to have an OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/). Once you have your API key, you can run the chatbot using the following command:

```bash
pip install bioimageio-chatbot
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxx
BIOIMAGEIO_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH=/path/to/bioimageio-knowledge-base    
python3 -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9000 --static-mounts /chatbot:./static --startup-functions=scripts/start-bioimageio-chatbot.py:register_chat_service
```

After this, you will be able to access the chatbot at `http://localhost:9000/chatbot/index.html`.
